# UwU-bot

My random discord bot UwU. <br>
Just a bot i made in my free time to mess around on my discord server. <br>
Obviously not perfect, I'm just a college student and never formally learn JavaScript. <br>
Feel free to use it as a reference for you own bot! <br>


## Commands

Disclaimer : I don't guarantee these commands will work on every computer.

* ### Hi Bot / Hello Bot

  Just say `hi bot` or `hello bot` and it will repond back with `Hi!` or `Hewwo!`. <br>
  Used for testing whether the bot is active or not.

* ### Command List
  Command : `!help` <br>
  Show the command list of the bot. <br>

* ### Ping Spam
  Command : `!ping <user mention> <interval> <count>` <br>
            `!stop` to stop it. <br>
  Will ping the mentioned user every `<interval>` minutes for `<count>` times. <br>
  Only works with my user id. You can change the message author id verification step to bypass it.

* ### Reminder
  Command : `!RemindMe <time> <message>` <br>
  Will notify the message author in `<time>` minutes. <br>

* ### UwU-fy Message
  Command : `!uwu <message>`. <br>
  Will uwu-fy the message, just try it. <br>
  Also it's not perfect.
