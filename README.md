# UwU-bot

My random discord bot UwU. <br>
Just a bot i made in my free time to mess around on my discord server. <br>
Obviously not perfect, I'm just a college student and never formally learn JavaScript. <br>
Feel free to use it as a reference for you own bot! <br>


## Commands

Disclaimer : I don't guarantee these commands will work on every computer.

* ### Hi Bot / Hello Bot

  Just say `hi bot` or `hello bot` and it will repond back with `Hi!` or `Hewwo!`. <br>
  Used for testing whether the bot is active or not.

* ### Command List
  Command : `!help` <br>
  Show the command list of the bot. <br>

* ### Ping Spam
  Command : `!ping <user mention> <interval> <count>` <br>
            `!stop` to stop it. <br>
  Will ping the mentioned user every `<interval>` minutes for `<count>` times. <br>
  Only works with my user id. You can change the message author id verification step to bypass it.

* ### Reminder
  Command : `!RemindMe <time> <message>` <br>
  Will notify the message author in `<time>` minutes. <br>

* ### UwU-fy Message
  Command : `!uwu <message>`. <br>
  Will uwu-fy the message, just try it. <br>
  Also it's not perfect.
  
* ### Kill
  Works everytime there's a word `kill` on the channel. <br>
  Will send and image of Matsumoto from Wataten.

* ### Dad
  Works everytime there's a word `i'm` on the channel. <br>
  Will send `Hi <message>, I'm bot`


* ### Helltaker
  Command : `!helltaker`. <br>
  Will send a random image from helltaker folder. <br>
  It's not in this repo because of nsfw.

* ### Another Reminder
  It's just my reminder for filling the attendance log on my online class. <br>
  It's janky.
  
* ### Retired Music Command
  Because there's too many error. <br>
  Also this is just me trying to learn how to make a music bot by following tutorial.
