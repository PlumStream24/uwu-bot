# UwU-bot

My random UwU bot. <br>
Just a bot i made in my free time to mess around on my discord server. <br>
Obviously not perfect, I'm just a college student and never formally learn JavaScript.


## Commands

Disclaimer : I don't guarantee these commands will work on every computer.

* ### Hi Bot / Hello Bot

  Just say hi to the bot and it will repond back with `Hi!` or `Hewwo!`. <br>
  Used for testing whether the bot is active or not.

* ### Ping Spam
  Command : `!ping <user mention>` to start the ping and `!stop` to stop it. <br>
  Will ping the mentioned user every minute for 5 minute. <br>
  Only works with my user id. You can change the message author id verification step to bypass it.
  
* ### UwU-fy Message
  Command : `!uwu <message>`. <br>
  Will uwu-fy the message, just try it. <br>
  Also it's not perfect.
  
* ### Kill
  Works everytime there's a word `kill` on the channel. <br>
  Will send and image of Matsumoto from Wataten.

* ### Dad
  Works everytime there's a word `i'm` on the channel. <br>
  Will send `Hi <message>, I'm bot`


* ### Helltaker Command
  Command : `!helltaker`. <br>
  Will send a random image from helltaker folder. <br>
  It's not in this repo because of nsfw.

* ### Reminder
  It's just my reminder for filling the attendance log on my online class. <br>
  It's jangky.
  
* ### Retired Music Command
  Because there's too many error. <br>
  Also this is just me trying to learn how to make a music bot by following tutorial.
